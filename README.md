2. Release Date
3. Rating
4. Director,Screenplay
5. Duration
6. Genre

Scrape data for the movies from 50 pages which makes the total to -> 1000 movies.

Show the data in an excel file.

**Results:**  Data has been captured for 1000 movies.

**Libraries Used:**
1. BeautifulSoup
2. Requests
3. Pandas
4. Regular Expressions

**Additional Software Used:**
Proton VPN to prevent the blocking of my IP Address.

**Limitations:**  If a movie has multiple Directors, the program will capture only the last director mentioned.
This can be improved by creating a list to capture all the Directors instead of using if else statements.
